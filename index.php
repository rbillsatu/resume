        <h3>Code Preference:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My preferred coding framework is certainly React for the flexibility and performance it provides.  The reusability of components is ideal for development speed as well as consistency throughout any application.</li>
            <li>I have utilized traditional relational databases, such as Oracle and MySQL.  However, my new interest is Firebase with NoSQL.  I think the performance out-shines traditional database query methods.</li>
